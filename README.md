# CNN_benign_malignant

I'm an undergraduate researcher for a lab in the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center.
While exploring machine learning, I made a simple CNN to look at breast cancer images.
The 2-part script can:
1) Train VGG16 (PyTorch) model on a dataset of images of Benign vs. Malignant cells, and
2) Test the model on a folder of images that can be from a separate dataset.

The first script is VGG_Carcinoma.py, and the second script is Trained_NN.py
This script has many issues and is somewhat incomplete, but I'll be leaving it like this for now as I'm starting a different project instead.
